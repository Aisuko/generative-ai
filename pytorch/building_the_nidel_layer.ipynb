The computations that happen in a neural network include applying an activation function. `If a neuron activates, then it means the input is important`. They are different kinds of activation functions. `The choice of which activation funciton to use dependes on what you want the output to be`. Another important role of an activation function is to `add non-linearity to the model`.\n",
