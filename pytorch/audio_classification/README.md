## Audio classification with PyTorch

We will learn how to do audio classification with PyTorch. And:
* how to transform the sound signals into a visual representation called spectrograms
* build the model by using CV on the spectrogram images
* build a speech classification model that can recognize sounds ot spoken words by using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

## Introduction

The assistant must conver the speech to text, and then convert the text into numbers(called `word embeddings`). The assistant then classifies the utterance and correlates it to the intent (what the speaker wants the voice assistant to do).
