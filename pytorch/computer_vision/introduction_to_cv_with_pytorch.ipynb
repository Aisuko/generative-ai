    "\n",
    "Computer Vision (CV) is a field that studies how computers can gain some degree of understanding form digital images and/or video. `Understanding` in this definition has a rather broad meaning - it can range from being able to distinguish between a cat and a dog on the picture, to more complex tasks such as describing the image in natural language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common problems of computer vision include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Image Classificatin** is the simplest task, when we need to classify an image into one of many pre-define categories, for example, distinguish a cat fromm a dog on a photograph, or recognize handwritten digits.\n",
    "* **Object Detection** is a bit more difficult task, in which we need to find known objects on the picture and localize them, that is, return the `bounding box` for each of recognized objects.\n",
    "* **Segmentation** is similar to object detection, but instead of giving bounding box we need to return an exact pixel map outlining each of the recognized objects."

    "Computer Vision works with Images. As you probably know, images consist of pixels, so they can be thought of as a rectangualr collection (array) of pixels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first part, we will deal with handwritten digit recognition. We will use the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits, 28x28 pixels. Each image can be represented as 28x28 array, and elements of this array would denote instensity of corresponding pixel-either in the scale of range 0 to 1 (in which case floating point numbers are used), or 0 to 255 (integers). A popular python library called `numpy` is often used with computer vision tasks, because it allows to operate with multidimensional arrays effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To deal with color images, we need some way to represent colors. In mose cases, we represent each pixel by 3 intensity values, corresponding to Red(R), Green(G) and Blue(B) components. This color encoding is called RGB, and thus color image of size $W * H$ will be represented as an array of size $3*H*W$ (sometimes tha order of components might be different, but the idea is the same).\n",

    "|Grayscale Image|RGB Image|\n",
    "|:---:|:---:|\n",
    "|5x5 Grayscale Image|5x5 Color (RGB) Image|\n",
    "\n",
    "Using multi-dimensional arrays to represent images also has an advatage, because we can use an extra dimentison to store a sequence of images. For example, `to represent a video fragment consisting of 200 frames with 800x600 dimension, we may use the tensor of size 200x3x600x800`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-dimensional arrays are also called `tensors`. Usually, we refers to tensors when we speak about some neural network framework, such as PyTorch. The main difference between tensors in PyTorch and numpy arrays is that tensors support parallel operations on GPU, if it is avaliable. Also, PyTorch offers additional functionality, such as automatic differentiation, when operation on tensors."
