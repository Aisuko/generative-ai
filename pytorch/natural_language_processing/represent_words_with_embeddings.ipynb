It helps `map the probability of a word`, based on the contexts from texts in the sequence. It is based on two main architectures that are used to produce a distributed representation of words:\n",
    "* **Continuous Bag-of-Words** (CBOW) - in this architecture, we train the model to predict a word from surrounding context. Given the ngram ($W_{-2},W_{-1},W_{0},W_{1},W_{2}$), the goal of the model is to predict $W_{0}$ from ($W_{-2},W_{-1},W_{1},W_{2}$). For example, \"I like my hot dog on a _\". Here the predicted word would be \"bun\".\n",

    "Both CBOW and Skip-Grams are \"predictive\" embeddings, in that they only take local contexts into account. Word2Vec does not take advantage of global context.\n",
    "* **GloVe**(Global Vectors) - derives the relationship between words. It determines how often a particular word-pair occurs together in a text by leveraging the idea of co-occurence matrix and uses neural methods to decompose co-occurence matrix into more expressive and non-linear word vectors.\n",
    "* **FastText** - builds on Word2Vec by learning vector representations are then averaged into one vector at each training step. While this adds a lot of additional computation ro pre-training, it enables word embeddings to encode sub-word information.\n",
