    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and their gated cell variants such as Long Short Term Memory Cells (LSTMs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) provided a mechanism for language modeling, i.e. they can leanr word ordering and provide predictions for next word in a sequence. This allows us to use RNNs for **generative tasks**, such as ordinary text "
