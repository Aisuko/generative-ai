    "\n",
    "A (denoising) diffusion model is not that complex if you compare it to other generatve models such as [Normalizing](https://aisuko.gitbook.io/wiki/ai-techniques/framework/ml_training_components#normalization) Flows, GANs or [VAEs](https://aisuko.gitbook.io/wiki/ai-techniques/stable-diffusion/vae):they all convert noise from some simple distribution to a data sample. This is also the case here where **a neural network leanrs to gradually denoise data** startubg from pure noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a bit more detail for images, the  set-up consists of 2 process:\n",
    "\n",
    "* a fixed (or predefined) forward diffusion process q of our choosing, that gradually adds Gaussian noise to an image, until you end up with pure noise.\n",
    "* a learned reverse denoising process p0, where a neural network is trained to gradually denoise an image starting from pure noise, until you end up with an actual image.\n",

    "![](https://huggingface.co/blog/assets/78_annotated-diffusion/diffusion_figure.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the picture above, both the forward and reverse process indexed by t happen for some number of finite time steps T (the DDPM authors use T=1000). You start with t=0 where you sample a real image x0 from your data distribution, and the forward process samples some noise from a Gaussian distribution at each time step t, which is added to the image of the previous time step. Given a sufficientlt large T and a well behaved schedule for adding noise at each time step, you end up with what is called an isotropic Gaussian distribution at t =T via a gradual process."

Hence the **variatinal lower bound** (ELBO) can be used to minimize the negative log-likelihood with respect to ground truth data sample X0. It turns out that the ELBO for this process is a sum of losses at each time step t, L=L0+L1+...+LT.\n",
