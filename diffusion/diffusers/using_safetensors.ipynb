    "Safetensors is a fast file format for sorting and loading tensors. Typically, PtTorch model weights are saved or pickled into a .bin file with Python's pickle utility. However, pickle is not secure and pickled files amy contain malicious code that can be executed. safetensors is a secure alternative to pickle, making it ideal for sharing model weights.\n",

    "Not all weights on the Hub are avaliable in the `.safetensors` format, and you may encounter weights stored as `.bin`. In this case, use the Conver Space to convert the weights to `.safetensors`. The Convert Space downloads the pickled weights, converts them, and opens a Pull Request to upload the newly converted `.safetensors` file on the hub. This way, if there is any malicious code contained in the pickled files, they are uploaded to the Hub - which has a security scanner to detect unsafe files and suspicious imports - instead of your computer. Here is the [convert code](https://huggingface.co/spaces/diffusers/convert/blob/main/convert.py)"
